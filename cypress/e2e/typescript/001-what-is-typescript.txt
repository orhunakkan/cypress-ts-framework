Typescript is four things:

1. Programming language
        - A language that includes all the existing Javascript snytax, plus new Typescript-scenific syntaxfor defining and using types
2. Type checker
        - A program that takes in a set of files written in Javascript or Typescript, develops an understanding of all the contructs (variables, functions etc.)
          created and lets you know if it thinks anything is set up incorrectly.
3. Compiler
        - A program that runs the type checker, reports any issues, then outputs the equivalent Javascript code.
4. Language service
        - A program that uses the type checker to tell the editors such as VS Code how to provide helpful utilities to developers.
